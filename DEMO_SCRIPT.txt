Phase 1: Introduction & Setup (The "Before" State)

Phase 2: Dynamic Menu Update (The "Magic" Moment)

Scene 3: Uploading a New Menu
*   Action: Stay on the "Menu & FAQs" tab.
*   Talking Point: "Let's say it's lunch time and we want to switch to our Burger menu. Instead of reprogramming the AI, we just upload a simple CSV file."
*   Action: Click "Choose File" and select `burger_menu.csv` (from the `sample_menus` folder).
*   Action: Watch the table update with the new items (Classic Cheeseburger, Milkshakes, etc.).
*   Talking Point: "And just like that, the AI now knows we sell burgers. No code changes required."

    *   Agent: (Will ask what you want).
    *   You: "What kind of burgers do you have?" (Testing menu knowledge).
    *   Agent: (Should list the burgers from the CSV you just uploaded).

    *   Agent: (Will confirm price/details).
    *   You: "Actually, can you add some Onion Rings to that?" (Testing modification).

*   Result: The agent should offer to transfer or take a message, which will appear in the "Call Logs".
